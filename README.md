Client Application Seed - basic starter views to Create, Read, Update and Delete.
Use with a [Rest API](https://github.com/rogatum/mongo-node-api-starter).

## Requirements

* Angular CLI -

## Running ( instruction taken from Angular.io )

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
